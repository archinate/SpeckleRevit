## About Speckle

Speckle reimagines the design process from the Internet up: an open source (MIT) initiative for developing an extensible Design & AEC data communication protocol and platform. Contributions are welcome - we can't build this alone! 

## Development

This repo currently contains four projects:
1. SpeckleView (Submodule) - The HTML5/JS/CSS UI based on Vue.js. Make sure that the first time you clone this repo you run `npm install`	and `npm run build` to generate the app files.
2. SpeckleCore (Submodule)
3. SpeckleRevitConverter
4. SpeckleRevitPlugin
